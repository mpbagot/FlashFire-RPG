You fall back, on the verge of death. Rane is too powerful.
/
Strevras Rane: As I said, you never had a chance. Now you have to pay for your stupidity!
/
Rane lifts his hands, yelling the words of a summoning. A dark form swirls around behind him, creating a human-like shape.
/
A sudden pop causes Rane's magic to fizzle.
/
???: You've been causing a lot of trouble for us Rane.
Strevras Rane: Torvalds! Damn it! How did you get through the network?
Linus Torvalds: It was built on Microsoft architecture, what did you expect?
/
Torvalds waves his hand, Rane roaring in pain as he fades away.
Linus Torvalds: I'm lucky he was using such weak security, I couldn't have reached you in time if he hadn't.
/
You: What the heck just happened?!?! How did you get here?
Linus Torvalds: See the 'magic' he was using? That's actually just a huge computer network, controlling matter and energy here.
/
You stand up, weakened.
You: Well stuff this. I'm heading home!
Linus Torvalds: Whatever, I've got stuff to do to.
/
You walk from the the lair, yawning and already beginning to relax.
