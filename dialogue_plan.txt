Basic Dialogue AI plan:

drop first word if that word is well,

the line is a question if it starts with who, what, when, where, why, how or is
the line is a question if it starts with 'will' followed by a pronoun
				(i.e, you, i, it, they, those, the, that, or a titlecase name)


the line begins with a conditional statement if it starts with where, for or if
						(split at comma, parse condition then statement)

the line is a statement under all other circumstances

try to parse meaning of questions and answer appropriately, optionally make on-topic chat after

try to pull keywords from statements, plus conditions if neccessary, store in a dictionary for
further conversation context.
